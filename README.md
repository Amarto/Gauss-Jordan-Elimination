Gauss-Jordan-Elimination
========================
Performs a variety of operations on matrices, solves linear systems, determines independence:
This was my attempt at coding up the problem solving algorithms from my linear algebra class as I learned them.

-Carries out the algorithm of Gauss-Jordan elimination on a given matrix to yield its reduced row echelon form. 

-For a square matrix, calculates the determinant. 

-Multiplies a matrix by a scalar

-Multiplies two matrices
